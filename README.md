## Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues

**OpenGL Context Not Available**
- Ensure your system has a compatible GPU with OpenGL 4.6+ support
- On Linux, verify GPU drivers are properly installed (`glxinfo` can help diagnose)

**Qt6 Configuration Issues**
- Verify Qt6 is properly installed: `qmake --version` should show Qt 6.8+
- On Linux, ensure `qt6-base-dev` is installed with OpenGL support
- On Windows, verify vcpkg Qt6 installation: `vcpkg list | grep qt6`

**Assimp Version Mismatch**
- Ensure Assimp 5.0.1 or later is installed
- Incompatible versions may cause linking errors or runtime crashes
- Rebuild Assimp from source if package manager version is outdated

**OpenCASCADE Not Found**
- On Linux: Verify installation with `pkg-config --cflags --libs OpenCASCADE`
- On Windows: Ensure vcpkg installation completed successfully
- Check CMake output for exact library names not found

**CMake Cannot Find Dependencies**
- On Linux: Set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to dependency locations
  ```bash
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  ```
- On Windows: Verify vcpkg triplet matches your build (x64-windows, x86-windows, etc.)

**OpenGL-Related Crashes**
- Ensure shaders compile successfully (check application logs)
- Verify all texture formats are supported by your GPU
- Try updating GPU drivers

### Performance Tips

- Use **Release builds** (`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`) for best performance
- **Reduce shadow map resolution** if rendering is slow
- **Disable unused KHR extensions** in settings if not needed
- **Use LOD variants** for very large assemblies or point clouds
- **Prefilter maps** are computed on load; large environment maps may take time

### Dependency Compatibility

**Recommended Versions:**
- Qt: 6.8 or later
- Assimp: 5.0.1 or later (5.2+ recommended)
- OpenCASCADE: 7.9 or later
- CMake: 3.16 or later (3.24+ recommended)
- GLM: 0.9.9 or later

**Known Issues:**
- OpenCASCADE < 7.8 may have compatibility issues
- Qt versions older than 6.6 lack some OpenGL optimizations
- MSVC 2019 or later recommended for Windows builds
